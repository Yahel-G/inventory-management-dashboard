## Features

- Responsive layout with Tailwind CSS  
- Light and Dark theme toggle

- Interactive charts (Bar, Pie, Area) using Recharts  
- Server-side data fetching from AWS API Gateway endpoints

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js  
- **Language:** TypeScript & React  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, CSS Variables for theming  
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit, RTK Query, redux-persist  
- **Charts:** Recharts  
- **Icons:** Lucide React  
- **Backend Integration:** AWS API Gateway  

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=16)  
- npm or yarn  
- AWS account with API Gateway endpoints configured  

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:  
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/inventory-management-dashboard.git  
    cd inventory-management-dashboard  

2. **Install dependencies**:  
    cd client  
    npm install (or `yarn install`)  
    cd ../server  
    npm install (or `yarn install`)  

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the `client/` directory with the following variables:  
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://<your-api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/<stage>  
    # Any other env variables your API requires  

## Theming (Light/Dark Mode)

- CSS custom properties are defined in `globals.css` under `:root` and `.dark`.  
- Tailwind maps color utilities to these variables (e.g., `bg-white` â†’ `var(--color-white)`).  
- Theme toggle adds/removes `.dark` on `<html>` and persists choice via `useDarkMode`.  

## API Integration

- Data is fetched with RTK Query (`useGetDashboardMetricsQuery`) from AWS API Gateway.  
- Endpoints return JSON with `salesSummary`, `expenseSummary`, etc.  

## Deployment

After `npm run build`, deploy to AWS:  
- **S3 & CloudFront:** Upload the `out/` directory and serve via CDN.  
- **Amplify:** Connect repo for automatic builds and hosting.  
- **EC2/ECS:** Run Node.js server, fronted by ALB.  

Ensure environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, etc.) are set in each service.
